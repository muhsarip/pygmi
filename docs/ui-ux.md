The Pygmi.io interface design you're seeing isn't actually a duplicate - it's a purposeful two-panel layout commonly used in AI generation tools:

**Center Area (Large Display):**

* Primary viewing canvas for examining your generated image in detail
* Allows you to see the full quality and details of the result
* Main workspace where you focus on evaluating the generation

**Right Sidebar (Thumbnail + Details):**

* **Reference panel** - keeps track of what you generated
* **Metadata display** - shows prompt, model used (Seedream 4.0), resolution (1024x1024), creation date
* **Action controls** - "Use", "Rerun", and download buttons
* **Quick access** - lets you reference settings without losing focus on the main area

**Why This Design?**

This layout allows you to:

1. Examine the full-quality image clearly in the center
2. Keep generation details visible without cluttering the main view
3. Quickly rerun or modify settings without navigating away
4. Compare multiple generations (the sidebar likely shows your generation history)
5. Take actions (use, download) while still viewing the result

It's similar to design software like Photoshop (large canvas + side panels) or music players (main view + playlist sidebar). The separation keeps the workspace clean while maintaining quick access to controls and information.
